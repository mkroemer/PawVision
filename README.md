## 🧪 Running Tests

PawVision uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for all unit and integration tests. All test files are located in the `tests/` directory and are organized by domain (e.g., config, statistics, web interface).

To run all tests:

```bash
python run_tests.py --all
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
python run_tests.py --file tests/test_config.py
```

To run a specific test class:

```bash
python run_tests.py --class TestConfigManager
```

To run a specific test class in a file:

```bash
python run_tests.py --file tests/test_config.py --class TestConfigManager
```

All tests should pass before submitting changes. Logging errors during test shutdown are harmless and only occur in test environments.

## 🛠️ Writing Tests

- Place new tests in the appropriate domain file in `tests/`
- Use the `unittest` framework (pytest will auto-discover)
- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Use temporary files and directories for isolation
- Mock hardware and external dependencies for reliability

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Documentation

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for setup, and [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) for API details. For test development, see the section above and the developer notes in each test file.
